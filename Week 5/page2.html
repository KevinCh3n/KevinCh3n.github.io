    <h2 class="content">I really like John Berger's opinion on how to connect moving people to still 
        paintings as "Because paintings are esseentially silent and still, the most 
        obvious way to manipulating them is to use movement and sound" Like in documentary,
        camera would moves in to remote the detail of the paintings as the whole. So as 
        human, by moving our bodies in close or far from that painting will enable us to
        have different understanding of the painting.

    <h2 class="content">Berger had talked about painting has lost something significant as a result of 
        the fact that any original piece can be photographed, reproduced, and placed anywhere in the world. 
        There is no longer the amazing feeling of knowing that it is the only one of its kind, but some 
        sense of value is lost because the camera has enabled copies and reproductions of the majority of 
        valuable paintings. This results in a loss of some sense of value.
