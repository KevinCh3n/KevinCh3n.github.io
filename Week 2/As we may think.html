    Vanivar Bush was an American engineer, inventor, and science administrator who headed the United States Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II. And in this article he makes predictions about the future of technology. I think the key one is something called memex. According to the article, memex is very similar to our smart phones and computers. It is a tool that can store large amounts of data and can be carried around with you. This article was published in 1945, and computers, smartphones, and the Internet were born after this article.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:30px; font-size:20px; color:rgb(255, 0, 0); text-align: center;font-family: Times New Roman;">So I think this article plays a key role in the future direction of technology development. Because in the past few years of our lives, the author did predict accurately. The ubiquitous smartphones on the street and the props that can store information all share similarities with memex.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:30px; font-size:20px; color:rgb(255, 0, 0); text-align: center;font-family: Times New Roman;">And I think Bush also expressed his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction in this article. Because it was published in 1945, and in 1945 there was a nuclear bombing. Therefore, I think he also wants to told us that the development of science and technology has both advantages and disadvantages. The progress of science and technology can improve people's social development ability and their own strength, while some people or countries that do not keep up with science and technology will be excluded or even eliminated because of the rapid progress of science and technology.
