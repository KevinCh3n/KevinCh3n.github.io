        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Berger had talked about painting has lost something significant as a result of the fact that any original piece can be photographed, reproduced, and placed anywhere in the world. There is no longer the amazing feeling of knowing that it is the only one of its kind, but some sense of value is lost because the camera has enabled copies and reproductions of the majority of valuable paintings. This results in a loss of some sense of value.</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">According to John Berger, the distinction between nudity and nakedness lies in whether or not the individual is conscious of the fact that they are being observed. A painting of the Adam and Eve story shows the couple eating the forbidden fruit and then coming to the realization that they are naked after doing so.</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">In European oil painting, naked ladies were a popular subject matter to depict. Berger makes the observation that, in the same manner that oil paintings showed riches by employing images of land and objects, women were also considered as property that might be flaunted.</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">In the concluding segment of John Berger's Ways of Seeing series, the author examines contemporary forms of public relations imagery, such as commercials, and draws parallels between such depictions and conventional oil paintings. He analyzes the original circumstances, poses, surroundings, and movements of both of them, among other things. Berger compares modern notions of glamour, notoriety, and advertising to their historical precedents in the context of the time period of traditional paintings. In addition to this, Berger proceeds to investigate the incoherence of the public relations advertisements that are published in magazines.</p>
