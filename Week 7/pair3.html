            <p class="text-grid">Perfect Sleep investigates sleep and dreaming as a potential climate engineering technology. By inviting participants to experiment with their own sleep cycles, the work explores how lack of sleep and climate change are both products of the same extractivist capitalist system where regeneration, rest and natural limits go unvalued.

                The work is realized in two parts: as a smart phone app and an installation.</p>

            <p class="text-grid">The Phenology Clock project sees the creation of annual clocks that show the timing of life cycle events for species in specific urban ecosystems. Shown are two clocks prepared for the ecosystems of Sydney and New York and that explore a relation in time and space.

                They are part of a project developed at the Environmental Health Clinic with Natalie Jeremijenko, Jake Richardson, Blacki Migliozzi and others. To see more information and a detailed clock for London phenology data, visit the site here. The Phenology Clock is also accompanied by a workshop that is documented here.</p></div>

            <p class="text-grid">white collar crime risk zone is pretty impressive in that instead of focusing on the homeless people or beggars he changed the view to white collars which seems to be the most stable group of people in the society</p>

            <p class="text-grid ">Another project is called Job Creator which is a custom brick. He didn't put anything on the webpage but this really reminds me of a word in Chinese while applying for job. It's called "敲门砖“ which can be directly translate to the brick that knockes the door. In daily life, we often use this to refer to the advantages which enables companies to hire us. Of course if you are not satisfy with the job, you can use this brick to knock boss's head.</p>
