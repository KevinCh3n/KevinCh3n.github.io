            <p class="text-split">In the early days of the outbreak, China was greatly affected.  Because the disease can spread in close proximity, everyone is confined to their homes.  And that caused a lot of companies to go bankrupt because people couldn't go out to work.  Many other people have no food to eat because of the pandemic.  The pandemic has kept people in a funk.  And I think it really encouraged people who were suffering from the epidemic.  So I like this project, It's very inspiring.</p>

        <p class="text-split">From my perspective, they made this project not only for those patients but also for those who lose their jobs during lockdown. If I were live under that depressing environment, I would probably feel released after seeing this sentences.
