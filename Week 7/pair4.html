<p style="font-size: 25px;">“Get well soon!” is an e-card comprised of an archive of over 200,000 unique messages of well wishes. The messages are scraped from comments of support on the popular crowd funding site gofundme.com, a self-described “leader in online medical fundraising”, which, due to lack of affordable healthcare in the United States is widely relied upon for funding vital medical procedures. Each message, although fully anonymous, speaks to a specific moment of care and genuine hope for wellness.

    Made in collaboration with Sam Lavigne.
    
    Get Well Soon was commissioned by Chronus Art Center and Rhizome during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.I've heard that the first group of people who got covid in 2020, most of them suffers a lot because their lung was disstorted into pieces. Many of them asked doctors to end their lives. I believe it is under that situation, Tega Brain and Sam Lagvine made this to encourage patient not to lose hope in life.</p>
